The program that I created alphabetically sorts a list of strings that are in a text file. I used the exchange sort algorithm and compareToIgnoreCase() method to accomplish this. 
To begin the program, the user inputs the name of the text file to sort and if the file doesn’t exist, the program exits. 
Second, the program asks the user to input the name of the text file to output the sorted strings to and if the file doesn’t exist, the program exits. 
Third, the program asks the user for an integer to create an array. The program then populates the array with the strings from the text file, line by line. 
Using this string array, the program implements the exchange sort algorithm to sort the strings alphabetically. 
Using a loop with a nested loop, the exchange sort algorithm is implemented in the first cell of the array and subsequent cell in ascending order. 
Using the compareToIgnoreCase() method the strings in the cells are evaluated. If the method returns a positive integer the strings are swapped.
After the loop has iterated through all the array cells, the program writes the sorted strings into the output file.
